<h2>Problem statement: [Busy Schedule with Confusion]</h2>
<p>
Students are busy and managing time is important. This is not helped by the fact that different professors may use completely different systems for managing classwork and homework. It is confusing when homework for one class is submitted by email while another is submitted on Blackboard and another on dropbox.
